# Simple responsive slider using jQuery

> This is a simple slider using **jQuery**. To install the necessary dependencies use the following commands:

    npm install

> After the installation has finished, either run:

    npm run build

> This will run the configured Webpack once and create a **dist** folder in the root of the app directory. If you wish to do any changes and have the Webpack build everything but without the repeating **build** command, use the following instead and **build** will run on every file save in the app:

    npm run watch
